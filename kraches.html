		<p>Kratié (Khmer: ក្រចេះ, Krâchéh [krɑˈceh]), alternatively spelled Kracheh or 
		Kraches, is a province of Cambodia located in the northeast. It borders 
		Stung Treng to the north, Mondulkiri to the east, Kampong Thom and Kampong 
		Cham to the west, and Tboung Khmum, and the country of Vietnam to the south.<br><br>

		The province’s capital is the town of Kratié located within the Kratié 
		Municipality.<br><br>
		
		The area now known as Kratié was part of the early first millennium Kingdom 
		of Funan until Funan itself was superseded and absorbed in the 6th century 
		by Chenla. Sampheak Borak, the former Royal Capital during the Chenla Era, 
		is located in Sambo District.[citation needed] In addition, Kratié has 
		Vihear Sasar Muayroy Pagoda built in the 16th century. This pagoda is 
		related to a Khmer legend Krapeur Nen Thun (Venerable Monk Thun, the 
		Crocodile). Kratié has several temples built in the 8th century such as 
		Khvas Pi, Pram, and Koh Kring that has perfect deities, ancient halls, 
		Khmer ancient houses, and French-style buildings. The area near Kratié 
		along the Mekong River was one of the most densely populated regions of the 
		pre-Angkorian era of Cambodia.<br><br>

		Lon Nol was the province's governor in 1945. During the Vietnam and 
		Cambodian Civil Wars and the subsequent Vietnamese presence against Khmer 
		Rouge in Cambodia, intense fighting took place in Kratié.[4] Operation Menu, 
		the 1969-1970 United States bombing campaign targeting Vietnamese supply 
		routes and bases in Cambodia and Laos, resulted in heavy bombardment of 
		Kratié.[4][5] Recovering unexploded ordnance and de-mining has been a major 
		initiative since at least the mid-2000s.
