		<p>Prey Veng (Khmer: ព្រៃវែង [prɨj.ʋɛːŋ]; "Long Forest") is a province (khaet) 
		of Cambodia. The capital is Prey Veng. With a population of 1.1 million 
		people, it is the third most populous province.<br><br>

        This densely populated agricultural region is located on the east bank of 
		the Mekong. The name literally means "long forest" in khmer, but the last 
		great forests have gradually disappeared there over 30 years to provide for 
		agricultural land.<br><br>

		In early Christian era, the province was a major center of the kingdom of 
		Funan, between economic and political capitals of the country what were Oc 
		Eo (now in the Vietnamese province of An Giang) and Angkor Borei (in the 
		Cambodian province of Takéo province).<br><br>

		However, with the advent of Chen-la, the hub of the kingdom moved farther 
		west, to Koh Ker and Angkor and the region lost its importance.<br><br>

		In the 15th century, the Khmer emperors, under threat from the Siamese 
		(former name of people of current Thailand) decided to resettle back to 
		the east, to Oudong, Lovek then Phnom Penh. Prey Veng did not favor them as 
		it was too close to another danger, namely the Annam. Nevertheless, they 
		formed an army at Ba Phnom in 1473 to defend against an invasion of Siam.<br><br>

		Under the French protectorate, the colonial authorities saw potential of the 
		region in terms of agriculture and fishing and its proximity to the French 
		colony of Cochin China. Mass deforestation took place, to create land for 
		agriculture.<br><br>

		In 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took power, the province experienced its first 
		famine, until 1977. Thousands of people in Prey Veng province were killed by 
		the Khmer Rouge and buried in mass graves.<br><br>

		As the Vietnamese army advanced in January 1979, the region regained its 
		position and became one of the first areas of Cambodia liberated from the 
		Khmer Rouge.<br><br></p>
