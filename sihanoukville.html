		<p>Preah Sihanouk (Khmer: ព្រះសីហនុ, UNGEGN: Preăh Seihânŭ, ALA-LC: Braḥ Sīhanu 
		[preah.səjhanu]), also Sihanoukville, is a province (khaet) in southwest 
		Cambodia on the Gulf of Thailand. The provincial capital, also called 
		Sihanoukville, is a deep water port city and a steadily growing and 
		diversifying urban center on an elevated peninsula.<br><br>

		First established as Kampong Som (Khmer: កំពង់សោម), the province was later 
		renamed in honor of former King Norodom Sihanouk, who orchestrated the 
		establishment of Sihanoukville city and the Sihanoukville municipality as 
		this took place alongside the construction of the Sihanoukville Port, which 
		commenced in June 1955. The only deep water port of Cambodia, it includes an 
		oil terminal and a transport logistics facility.<br><br>

		Preah Sihanouk is divided into four districts, each with a distinct economic 
		character, defined largely by location and access to resources. In addition 
		to the port and the growing tourism industry, the activities of countless 
		NGOs and international investment have contributed to the rapid economic 
		growth of the province over the course of the last decade. Primary economic 
		sectors are transport and logistics, process manufacturing, agriculture and 
		fisheries, textiles, and real estate.<br><br>

		The islands and beaches of Preah Sihanouk Province are an international 
		tourist destination as visitor numbers have risen steadily since the 
		late-20th century.<br><br>

		Sihanoukville municipality was elevated to provincial status on 22 December 
		2008 after King Norodom Sihamoni signed a decree converting the 
		municipalities of Kep, Pailin, and Sihanoukville into provinces, as well as 
		incorporating Kompong Seila District.[12][13] As one of Cambodia's 
		agriculturally and industrially most diverse provinces, its economic future 
		has a solid basis, although the essential sectors of agriculture and tourism 
		require strict and permanent administrative protection of local natural 
		resources.</p>
