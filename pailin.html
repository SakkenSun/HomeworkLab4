		<p>Pailin (Khmer: ប៉ៃលិន, Pailĭn [ˈpajlɨn]) is a province in western Cambodia at
		the northern edge of the Cardamom Mountains near the border of Thailand. 
		This province is surrounded by Battambang province, and was officially 
		carved out of Battambang to become a separate administrative division after 
		the surrender of the Ieng Sary faction of the Khmer Rouge in 1996. Pailin is 
		known to much of the world for having long been a stronghold of the Khmer 
		Rouge, remaining under their control long after they were defeated in 
		1979 and serving from 1994 to 1998 as the capital of the Provisional 
		Government of National Union and National Salvation of Cambodia. Within 
		Cambodia, Pailin is known for its natural resources, namely precious gems 
		and timber.<br><br>

		Once a part of the powerful Khmer Empire, Pailin was conquered in 1558 by 
		the Burmese under Bayinnaung and later ruled by the Siamese (Thai) until 
		1907 and from 1941 to 1946 when it was returned to Cambodia. It was known 
		to the Thai as "Phailin" (Thai: ไพลิน, Thai pronunciation: [pʰāj.lin]). There 
		is still a vibrant border crossing point in Pailin. On 22 December 2008, 
		King Norodom Sihamoni signed a Royal Decree that changed the municipalities 
		of Kep, Pailin and Sihanoukville into provinces, as well as adjusting 
		several provincial borders.</p>
