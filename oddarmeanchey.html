		<p>Oddar Meanchey (Khmer: ឧត្តរមានជ័យ, UNGEGN: Ŏttâr Méanchoăy, ALA-LC: Uttar 
		Mānajăy [ʔoɗɑː miəncɨj]; lit. 'Victorious North') is a province of Cambodia 
		in the remote northwest. It borders the provinces of Banteay Meanchey to the
		west, Siem Reap to the south and Preah Vihear to the east. Its long northern
		boundary demarcates part of Cambodia's international border with Thailand. 
		The capital is Samraong.<br><br>

		The province was created on 27 April 1999, after being carved from the 
		northern half of Siem Reap province and part of Banteay Meanchey. It existed
		as a province already from 1962 to 1970 under Norodom Sihanouk's Sangkum 
		regime, but later became an administrative no-man's-land, with its status 
		alternating between a province and a district under successive regimes.</p>
