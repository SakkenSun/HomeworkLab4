		<p>Stung Treng (Khmer: ស្ទឹងត្រែង, UNGEGN: Stœ̆ng Trêng [stɨŋ traeŋ]; Lao: ຊຽງແຕງ, 
		Xiang Taeng; lit. "River of Reeds") is a province of Cambodia in the 
		northeast. It borders the provinces of Ratanakiri to the east, Mondulkiri 
		and Kratié to the south and Kampong Thom and Preah Vihear to the west. Its
		northern boundary is Cambodia's international border with Laos. The Mekong
		River bisects the province. The province is mostly covered by forest, but 
		logging and fishing put high pressure on the forest and fishery reserves.<br><br>
		Originally, Stung Treng was named "Tonle Ropov (Khmer: ទន្លេរពៅ), which is now an 
		area in Stung Treng called "Tonle Ropov Area" (Khmer: តំបន់ទន្លេរពៅ).<br><br>

		The name “Satung Teng (Khmer: សាទឹងទែង)" was founded by a monk named "Seang 
		Peng (Khmer: សៀង ប៉េង) from Vientiane. The words “Satung Teng" have changed to 
		"Xiang Taeng (Khmer: សៀងទែង). In Lao, the word "Xiang" means "goddess" who has
		resigned, while the word “Taeng” means "built".<br><br>

		Due to advancement in the Khmer language, it was later called "Stung Treng 
		(Khmer: ស្ទឹងត្រែង)" which means a river of reeds.<br><br>
