		<p>Battambang (Khmer: បាត់ដំបង, Bătdâmbâng [ɓatɗɑmɓɑːŋ]; "Lost Stick") is a 
		province (khaet) of Cambodia in the far northwest of the country. Bordering 
		provinces are Banteay Meanchey to the north, Pursat to the east and south, 
		Siem Reap to the northeast, and Pailin to the west. The northern and southern
		extremes of the province's western boundaries form part of the international 
		border with Thailand. In addition, Tonlé Sap forms part of the northeastern 
		boundary between Siem Reap and Pursat. Its capital and largest city is 
		Battambang.<br><br>

		It is the fifth most populous province in Cambodia. In land area, Battambang 
		is the fifth largest province of Cambodia. Battambang is one of the provinces
		included in the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve. The province's fertile rice 
		fields have led to a mostly agricultural economy giving rise to the moniker 
		"the rice bowl of Cambodia". The province features a range of cultures as 
		well as natural resources. Seventy five percent of the area is jungles and 
		mountains. The area has a tropical climate.</p>
