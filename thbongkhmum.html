		<p>Tboung Khmum (Khmer: ត្បូងឃ្មុំ [tɓoːŋ kʰmum]; meaning "Amber"), also spelled 
		as Tbong Khmum, is a province of Cambodia located on the central lowlands of 
		the Mekong River. It borders the provinces of Kampong Cham to the west, 
		Kratié to the north, Prey Veng to the south, and shares an international 
		border with Vietnam to the east. Its capital and largest city is Suong. The 
		province's name consists of two words in Khmer, tboung (gem, precious jewel)
		and khmum (bee), which together mean "amber".<br><br>

		Tboung Khmum Province was formed when Kampong Cham Province was split in two 
		by a royal decree signed on 31 December 2013 by King Norodom Sihamoni on the 
		recommendation of Prime Minister Hun Sen. The request by Hun Sen's 
		government to split the province, which was ostensibly for the purpose of 
		improving administrative efficiency in the large province, was made after 
		his ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) lost the province to the 
		opposition in the July 2013 elections.The CPP won only eight of the 
		available 18 National Assembly seats in Hun Sen's home province. The 10 
		districts that remain in Kampong Cham overwhelmingly voted for the 
		opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, led by Sam Rainsy, while five of 
		the six districts cut out from Kampong Cham to form the Tboung Khmum 
		Province were won solidly by the CPP. The province has the highest 
		percentage of Muslim population in the country, at 11.8%.</p>
