		<p>Takéo (Khmer: តាកែវ, [taːkaew], lit. 'Crystal Grandfather') is a province 
		(khaet) of Cambodia. Located in the south of Cambodia to the west of Bassac 
		River, Takéo borders the provinces of Kampot to the west, Kampong Speu to 
		the northwest and Kandal to the north and east. Its southern boundary is the 
		international border with Vietnam (An Giang). The provincial capital, 
		recently known as the provincial town Doun Kaev (formerly called Takeo), is 
		a small city with a population of 39,186.<br><br>

		Takéo is often referred to as the "cradle of Khmer civilization" due to the 
		former kingdom of Funan and its successor, Water Chenla, being centered in 
		the region.</p>
