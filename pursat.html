		<p>Pursat (Khmer: ពោធិ៍សាត់, UNGEGN: Poŭthĭsăt, ALA-LC: Bodhi ̊sât [poːsat]; 
		meaning "Floating Banyan") is a province of Cambodia. It is in the western 
		part of the country and borders clockwise from the north: Battambang 
		province, the Tonlé Sap, Kampong Chhnang province, Kampong Speu province, 
		Koh Kong province, and Thailand. It lies between the Tonle Sap and the 
		northern end of the Cardamom Mountains. The Pursat River bisects the 
		province, running from the Cardamoms in the west to the Tonle Sap in the 
		east.<br><br>

		The fourth largest province of Cambodia in area, Pursat ranks only 14th in 
		population. The region is accessible by National Highway 5, by boat, rail 
		and by numerous smaller roads. The capital, Pursat town, lies 174 kilometres 
		north west of Phnom Penh by road and 106 kilometres south east of 
		Battambang.<br><br>

		Pursat is home to Wat Bakan, considered to be among the oldest active 
		pagodas in Cambodia and revered as one of the most holy sites of Cambodian 
		Buddhism. The province also hosts the annual River Run Race, an event that 
		includes 5 km and 10 km races that generally follow the path of the Pursat 
		River for men and women, including those requiring wheelchairs. Since its 
		inaugural race in 2007, the event has grown to the second largest of its 
		kind in Cambodia</p>
