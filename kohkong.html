		<p>Koh Kong (Khmer: កោះកុង, Kaôh Kŏng [kɑh koŋ]) is a province (khaet) of 
		Cambodia. Its capital is Khemarak Phoumin (Koh Kong). <br><br>
		The most southwestern province of Cambodia, Koh Kong has a long undeveloped 
		coastline and a mountainous, forested, and largely inaccessible interior 
		which includes part of the Cardamom Mountains, Cambodia's largest national 
		park (Botum Sakor National Park), and a section of Kirirom National Park.<br><br>
		From 1795 to 1904 the area was under Siamese administration with the local 
		name of "Koh Kong". During the reign of King Mongkut the name Patchan Khiri 
		Khet was given to the city as a counterpart to Prachuap Khiri Khan, a city 
		on the same latitude which also had its name changed during the same year. 
		In 1904, the region and the city of Trat was ceded to French Indochina in 
		exchange of French troop evacuation from Chanthaburi. In 1907 Trat was 
		returned to Siam in exchange for the Siamese province of Inner Cambodia 
		while Koh Kong remained part of French Cambodia.<br><br>
		After Cambodia's liberation from the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Koh Kong province 
		was quite under-populated. After the national government encouraged people 
		to live in Koh Kong, there has been a net influx of people. It is estimated
		that the average annual growth rate in Koh Kong is 16%, which has put 
		pressure on the mangrove resources in the province. Koh Kong's towns have 
		developed rapidly partially in response to market pressures from Thailand 
		and because of immigration from other parts of Cambodia.
