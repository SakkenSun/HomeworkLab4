		<p>Kampong Cham (Khmer: កំពង់ចាម, IPA: [kɑmpɔŋ caːm]; lit. 'Cham Port') is a 
		province of Cambodia located on the central lowlands of the Mekong River. 
		It borders the provinces of Kampong Chhnang to the west, Kampong Thom and 
		Kratié to the north, Tboung Khmum to the east, and Prey Veng and Kandal to 
		the south. Kampong Cham was officially divided into two provinces on 31 
		December 2013 in what was seen by many as a political move by the ruling 
		party. All land west of the Mekong remained Kampong Cham while land east of 
		the river became Tbong Khmum province. Prior to this division, Kampong Cham 
		extended eastward to the international border with Vietnam, was the eleventh 
		largest province in Cambodia, and with a population of 1,680,694, was the 
		most populous province in Cambodia. Its capital and largest city is Kampong 
		Cham.</p>
