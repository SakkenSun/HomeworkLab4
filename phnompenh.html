		<p>Phnom Penh (/pəˌnɒm ˈpɛn, ˌpnɒm -/; Khmer: ភ្នំពេញ, Phnum Pénh [pʰnomˈpɨɲ]) 
		is the capital and most populous city of Cambodia. It has been the national 
		capital since the French protectorate of Cambodia, and has grown to become 
		the nation's economic, industrial, and cultural centre.<br><br>

		Phnom Penh succeeded Angkor Thom as the capital of the Khmer nation but was 
		abandoned several times before being reestablished in 1865 by King Norodom. 
		The city formerly functioned as a processing center, with textiles, 
		pharmaceuticals, machine manufacturing, and rice milling. Its chief assets, 
		however, were cultural. Institutions of higher learning included the Royal 
		University of Phnom Penh (established in 1960 as Royal Khmer University), 
		with schools of engineering, fine arts, technology, and agricultural 
		sciences, the latter at Chamkar Daung, a suburb. Also located in Phnom Penh 
		were the Royal University of Agronomic Sciences and the Agricultural School 
		of Prek Leap.<br><br>

		Once known as the "Pearl of Asia", it was considered one of the loveliest 
		French-built cities in Indochina in the 1920s. Phnom Penh, along with Siem 
		Reap and Sihanoukville, are significant global and domestic tourist 
		destinations for Cambodia. Founded in 1372, the city is noted for its 
		historical architecture and attractions. It became the national capital in 
		1434 following the fall of Angkor, and remained so until 1497. It regained 
		its capital status during the French colonial era in 1865. There are a 
		number of surviving colonial-era buildings scattered along the grand 
		boulevards.<br><br>

		On the banks of the Tonlé Sap, Mekong, and Bassac Rivers, Phnom Penh is home 
		to more than 2 million people, approximately 14% of the Cambodian population. 
		The Greater Phnom Penh area includes the nearby Ta Khmau city and some 
		districts of Kandal province.</p>
